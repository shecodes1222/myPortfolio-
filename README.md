# myPortfolio-

What was your motivation? 
My motivation has always been to prove to myself and my kids that I can accomplish hard things. 
Why did you build this project? To showcase the projects I have contributed in and helped design.
What problem does it solve? 
Git hub issues- I created a repo and then created a local folder with a different name than the one in my repo. None of my commits were being made. I decided to create a new repo and open with github desktop. I copied over the code I had been working on in my local file. I also ran into positioning, and sizing issues with my images. I researched and found css properties that fixes my problem. I also fixed the font for some of the text in my navbar and made it more simple.
What did you learn? I learned that how to position images and resize them using css properties. I learned how to style/resize a navbar. I learned to push through even when you feel like giving up.
What makes your project stand out? My project is a work in progress. I am going to continue improving and designing and I realized I really enjoy css! I'm really good at it and excited to see my growth as a developer.
